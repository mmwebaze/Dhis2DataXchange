Dhis2DataXchange
================

A Symfony 3 based project that exchanges data with DHIS2. This project is similar to the project DHIS2_DataXchange
with the only major difference that Dhis2DataXchange is built using Symfony 3 framework while DHIS2_DataXchange
 isn't built using any framework. This project is also being used in a Drupal 8 DHIS2 module to pull data out of DHIS2
  and into a Drupal 8 CMS.
